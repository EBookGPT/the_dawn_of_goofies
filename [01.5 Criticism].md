This story is a textbook example of "telling" rather than "showing." It's a parade of exposition, a constant barrage of information about the setting, characters, and plot points, but very little is actually *experienced* by the reader.  Let's break it down:

**1. Lack of Sensory Detail:**  We're told the world is bleak, but we don't *feel* it.  "The sun, a pale, anemic disk in a sky perpetually choked with ash" - that's telling us, not showing us. We need to smell the ash, feel the wind on our skin, see the colors of the sky, and hear the sounds of the desolate city.

**2. Flat Characterization:**  Anya is described as a "silent predator," "a warrior," and a "fighter," but we don't see those traits in action. We know she's good at fighting Goofies, but we don't get a sense of her personality, her motivations, or her internal struggles.  She feels like a placeholder, a generic hero. The same goes for Elias and the other characters.

**3. Dialogue as Information Dump:**  Dialogue is a powerful tool for revealing character and moving the plot forward, but here it's mostly used to explain things to the reader.  Elias's exposition about the Watcher feels unnatural and forced.  Instead of telling us what the Watcher is, show us their influence through actions, encounters, or even whispers in the shadows.

**4. Predictable Pacing:**  The story follows a predictable formula:  Introduction, conflict, resolution, repeat.  There's no tension or surprise.  The story needs to be broken up, with unexpected events, internal conflict, and moments of stillness that allow the reader to breathe.

**5.  Lack of Emotional Connection:**  The story is full of dramatic events, but they lack emotional impact because they're told to us, not shown to us. We're told Anya's sister was mutated, but we don't feel her grief.  We're told the Watcher is scary, but we don't experience the fear.

**Here's how to improve the story:**

**Show, don't tell:**  Instead of describing Anya's scar, show us her reaction when someone touches it.  Instead of telling us the world is bleak, show us a scene where a character stumbles through the rubble, feeling the cold, hearing the wind, smelling the decay.

**Focus on dialogue:**  Instead of having Elias explain the Watcher, show us a scene where Anya overhears a conversation, or sees a strange symbol left behind, hinting at the Watcher's presence.

**Develop characters:**  Give Anya a flaw, a fear, a secret desire.  Let her make mistakes, struggle with her emotions, and have moments of vulnerability. Show us her relationship with Mila, their shared grief, and their tentative trust.

**Create tension:**  Don't let the reader guess what will happen next.  Introduce unexpected twists, false leads, and dangerous situations that raise the stakes.  

**Focus on imagery:**  Use powerful descriptions to create a vivid sensory experience for the reader. Let them see the world through Anya's eyes, feel her fear, hear the wind, smell the ashes.

**Remember:**  A good story is an experience, not just a list of facts.  Give your readers something to feel, something to think about, and something to remember long after they finish reading.
